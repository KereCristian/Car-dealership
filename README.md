This C++ project implements a car management system, incorporating concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). 
It includes classes for different types of cars, such as petrol, diesel, hybrid, and electric, each with specific attributes and functionalities.
Users can input car details like brand, license plate number, year of fabrication, average consumption, and kilometers traveled.
The program sorts cars based on fabrication year, calculates fuel costs and consumption, counts cars by fuel type, and validates license plate numbers.
Through these features, the project showcases the application of OOP principles for effective code organization and implementation.
